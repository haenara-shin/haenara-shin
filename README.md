### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 'Machine Learning and Data Science' and 'Materials Science and Engineering.' 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Reinforcement Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks, Recommender System, and GPU Programming.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning applied to Materials Science, Deep Learning to Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning to Baduk(GO) and Recommender system building.
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help with Machine Learning and iOS App development. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: haenara.shin(at)gmail.com, has163(at)ucsd.edu
- ðŸ˜„ There are many private hidden repositories for course materials of ECE/CSE@UCSD, ML projects(competition, personal projects) and Coding interview practice(LeetCode problem solving) here.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Since 2006, I have been doing weight-lifting and bodybuilding. I won the bodybuilding competition in Daejeon, South Korea, and my big three record is 585kg (1290lbs).

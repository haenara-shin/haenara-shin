- 🔭 I’m currently working on 'Machine Learning and Data Science'. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Vision, TimeSeries ML/DL tasks and developing the simple stock-trading system.
- 😎 I (soon) become a Kaggle Expert in Code Competition section.
  * For the [PetFinder.my - Pawpularity Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-pawpularity-score), I am (tentatively) ranked at 170/3545 - Top 5% (in private LB, soon to be finalized in a week). ✨Silver medal✨ will be awarded 😊
  * For the [chaii - Hindi and Tamil Question Answering](https://www.kaggle.com/c/chaii-hindi-and-tamil-question-answering), which is my first Natural Language Processing (NLP) competition, I am ranked at 73/943 - Top 8% (in private LB). ✨Bronze medal✨ is awarded 😊.
- :tada: Our team(Many thanks to [@seungwon song](https://github.com/sw-song) and [@jiyoon baek](https://github.com/jiyoonbaekbaek)) for '2021 Deep Learning AI Competition in South Korea' won a contest (1st place: Awarded for the Commissioner of the Korean Intellectual Property Office Award - '특허청장상'). Hurray Hurrah! Please check :blush: and star :star2: this [The Pet's Face Aging/Rejuvenation GAN project - Throwback to when your pets were babies using GAN time machine](https://github.com/haenara-shin/GAN_Project)
- 🤔 Will be updated soon. 
- 😄 There are many private hidden repositories for course materials of ECE/CSE@UCSD, ML projects and Coding interview practice.
- 💬 Hidden repos. (course materials @UCSD)
  * CSE250B(AI algorithms) | ECE225A (Statistics) | ECE228 HW (ML for Physical App.) | ECE271B HW(Stat. Learning) | ECE271C (Deep Learning)
  * Most of repositories related to the course materials @UCSD are now back to the private.
  * Please do not copy or fork the repos. related to the UCSD classes' materials. Also, I will not repond to the inquiry or emails related to them.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 'Machine Learning and Data Science' and 'Materials Science and Engineering.' 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GAN, GNN, and DFT calculation.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ML applied to Materials Science.
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help with ML and iOS App development.
- ðŸ˜„ There are many private hidden repositories for course materials of ECE/CSE@UCSD, ML projects and Coding interview practice.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: haenara.shin(at)gmail.com, has163(at)ucsd.edu

- âš¡ Fun fact: Since 2006, I have been doing weight-lifting and bodybuilding. I won the bodybuilding competition in Daejeon, South Korea, and my big three record was 585kg (1290lbs) before covid-19.
